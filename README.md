# Interview Scheduler
Scheduler is a single-page React application that allows students to book interviews with a mentor. Students can create, edit, and delete their appointments. The data is being retrieved from an API, and when there are changes to a booking that data is sent to the API to persist using a PostgreSQL database. It has included Jest unit tests, Storybook visual tests, and Cypress end-to-end-tests.
